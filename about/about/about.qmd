I'm a Southern California native and graduated with my PhD in statistics from UCLA in 2018 under the (incredible) advisement of Rick Schoenberg. 
My PhD research focused on computational methods and applications for self-exciting point processes, which is a class of model I'm still very interested in (Check out my research page for more info on that). 
While a grad student, I also started working in the realm of statistics education under the leadership of Rob Gould. This is another area where I, personally, find a lot of value and one that I find is of interest to a great many students.
Prior to all that, I earned Bachelor's degrees in both math and economics at Cal State Fullerton, both of which are fields that continue to intrigue me to this day.

Since starting as an Assistant Professor of Statistics at Oregon State, I've enjoyed teaching an abundence of statistical methods courses for stats and non-stats (Read: _Real science_) graduate students. You can find out more about my students (All of whom are awesome) on my Students page. Working with as many students as I do typically results in getting to work on quite a few fun computational problems, which often feels like another perk of the job.

Outside of work, I'm grateful to be a travel and adventure buddy to my wife, Jennifer, and keeper of our cat and puppy, Nimbus and French Toast. I love to spend my off-time doing yard work or hiking and kayaking all around Oregon.
