#### Assistant Professor of [Statistics at Oregon State University](https://stat.oregonstate.edu). 

Big fan of computing. Often working on applications and methods for self-exciting point processes, but also into tools and methods for teaching statistics in university and high school settings. Find [my work contact info here](https://stat.oregonstate.edu/node/1574).

### Site is a bit under construction at this point, so more coming soon.
